# Excel-Projects

This is my **Excel Projects** repository! It contains various projects built using Microsoft Excel, leveraging different functions and formulas. The projects focus on data analysis, data visualization, and reporting to support better decision-making. 

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository serves as a centralized space to store and track all my Excel projects, improving efficiency and accessibility for future enhancements and collaborations.  

## 📌 Projects Included  
1. **Budget Tracker**
   
This project is a Budget Tracking project which is a simple and efficient tool for managing income, expenses, and savings.

The **Income Breakdown** chart shows how your salary is affected by deductions like taxes, insurance, and superannuation. These reduce your total income, but a bonus adds to it, resulting in your final net income. This Waterfall Chart is useful for tracking budget changes and understanding how different amounts increase or decrease over time.

The **Expenses Breakdown** chart shows how your total spending is divided into different categories. The biggest costs are for housing and food, followed by smaller expenses like travel, fuel, gym, and phone bills. This Funnel Chart helps show how expenses decrease step by step. It is often used to track spending or see where people drop off in a process, like a customer journey.

The **% Expenses chart** is a Donut Chart, which looks like a pie chart but has a hole in the middle. It shows that 94% of your income goes to expenses, leaving only 6% as savings. Donut charts are great for dashboard reports because they look clean and make it easy to compare parts of a whole. They are often used instead of pie charts when you need a modern look with space for extra labels.
